## What are Trademarks?

Trademarks are names, logos, and designs that identify the source of goods or services. The Apache License 2.0 grants broad permissions for the use, modification, and distribution of the Cleo software, but **it does not grant permission to use Huminary Labs' trademarks**.

- Suggest official endorsement

## Special Considerations for Open Source

### Code Contributions

### Forks and Modifications
You may fork and modify Cleo under the Apache License 2.0, but must:
- Remove all Cleo branding from your version
- Use a different name for your distribution
- Not suggest official endorsement

### Package Managers
When distributing through package managers (npm, pip, etc.), use names that:
