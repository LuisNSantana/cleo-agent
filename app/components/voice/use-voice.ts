 * Main voice hook - uses Railway WebSocket as primary with WebRTC as fallback

 * Railway WebSocket (Default):
 * - More reliable in restrictive networks (corporate, VPN, etc.)
 * - Works on all networks that allow WebSocket (TCP-based)
 * - Uses Railway proxy server to add authentication headers
 * 
 * WebRTC (Fallback - set NEXT_PUBLIC_VOICE_TRANSPORT=webrtc):
 * - Direct browser-to-OpenAI connection
 * - Lower latency when network allows
 * - Requires STUN servers for NAT traversal
 * - May fail on restrictive networks
