Yes. All credentials are encrypted using industry-standard encryption and stored securely. We never store or transmit credentials in plain text.

### Can I remove an integration later?
Absolutely. You can disable or remove any integration at any time from the Integrations page.

### Do integrations cost extra?
Cleo Agent integrations are free. However, some third-party services (like SerpAPI) have their own pricing plans.
